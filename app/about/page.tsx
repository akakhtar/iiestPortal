                to manage the details of the faculty members and alumni of the prestigious Indian Institute of Engineering Science and 
                Technology (IIEST), Shibpur. This platform allows seamless storage, management, and access to vital information about

                interface, administrators will be able to efficiently manage the data and provide valuable insights to both current 
                faculty and alumni.
